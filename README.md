# Meowies API

This is the API for meowies -- a meal time tracker for cats (and dogs)!

# Documentation

This project uses Swagger to auto-generate documentation -- once the app is running, go to the `/api` endpoint for documentation!

# Credits

The boilerplate for this project leverages the excellent [NestJS Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero/) Udemy course by Ariel Weinberger!
